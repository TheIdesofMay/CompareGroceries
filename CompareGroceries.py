# Shopping companion tool:

# * Input: the name of the product you want - either a specific brand of something or a more general item, such as chicken
# * The app will then go through a predefined list of stores (Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsburys etc..)
# * Itâ€™ll then search through them, extract the price of the item and the amount
# * Then show the price of the item 

# TODO:
# more shops


# how do we lay this out
# class SearchQ
# supermarket Class where the parameters you pass are the shopping centres you want to search 
# class Product(name)
